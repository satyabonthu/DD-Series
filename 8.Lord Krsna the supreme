But he is ever detached from this material world.

Like rich man sitting at home maintains everything..
Lord Krishna have unlimited energies , this universe maintainance is very easy.
It is not maintained by its own, behind that Lords control is there.

We can not create even an exact flower that nature do..
We do not understand how it is going on and think it is created by own.

Spaceship creation needs lot of technology and people.
In nature millions of planets are revolving.

When Issac Newton friend saw planetary model , very wonderfully designed. Enquired about creator.
Then Newton said that
It is just happened by nature I kept some plaster of Paris and it is build.

Imagining that there is no controller for material nature is foolish.

Under his power all things are happening.
As we can't see we should not say that there is no controller.

Doctor frog philosophy:
Visitor frog from atlantic ocean visits a frog at well.
Tiny brain experienced tiny well and asked vastness of oceans in times of well water.

He is the basis for everything.
Supreme controller of everything.
He doesn't has to struggle.
We are imitating controlling position of God and struggling.

Under his supervision material things created.
Hand is God and shadow is nature.
According to the movement of hand  shadow appears.

Some scientist of incomplete knowledge try to deal understand the  life subjects and declares that there is no God.

Scientist can't create one mosquito from chemicals.
Even the source of chemicals is God.

Lord Krishna is the controller of every moment.
We are little controllers.
Certain range of control we can exhibit.
According our karma we have been awarded power.
That power is given by god according to our karma.

At any time this power can be taken away.
We are attached and think that we are the doer.

There is an insect called indragopa...
Indra is said to be the king of demigod.
From indra and indragopa are being controlled by god and they all are under karma bandana.

But even Lord brahma bewildered by Krishnas power.
Brahma went to visit Krishna in Dwaraka.
At the gate Brahma informed gate keeper that brahma came to visit Krishna.
Krishna asked him that which Brahma he is.
Brahma told that he is the father of 4 kumaras and have 4 heads.
After allowing him to see Krishna he asked Krishna how many Brahmas are there.
Then Krishna showed him innumerable Brahmas with lot of heads.
He completely bewildered.
Millions of heads touching simultaneously lotus feet of Krishna.
Brahma is a position of universe.
Each universe has its own brahma, devathas...
Each brahma are thinking that they are unique and bewildered.
Brahma understood and astonished.

He says all Krishnas expansions are beyond his imagination.

It is a tiny universe we are so proud of our little power in office and home and baffled. Even
Lord brahma also very tiny in front of god.

From the pores of mahavishnu all these material natures are expanding.
Mahavishnus are expansions of Krishna.

Krishna is clearly mentioned that he is the supreme controller.

Research is already done and it is there in scriptures.

Whenever we feel proud of our duties and power we should remember this brahma story of Dwaraka.
