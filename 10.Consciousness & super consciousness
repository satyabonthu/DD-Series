Bg 2.19
Difference between dead and living is consciousness..
Soul is the source of consciousness
It is not coming by material combination
Everything can be replaced in body but not soul.
Consciousness is pervading the body is imperishable
Sunshine is spread all over the body from the sun situated at a place
Consciousness is transmitted by blood
Soul is at heart...
What happens in the case of heart transplantation..It sits there
Our consciousness is limited
13 chapter
It knows what is going inside the body but not other body
One more super soul is there that is krishna
Driver car  soul body and the controller is para matham  ksherodekadaya krishna
Soul of the soul super soul situated beside the soul
Part and parcel of that consciousness
Krishna says:
I know all that happened hapenning and heapen  and I know every one
Even brahma many heads cannot understand small part of supremesoul
Therefore our understanding is infitesemal
God: origin of everything
We have limited consciousness within the body directly ..We dont know what is going inside body
If u wana scratch when there is itching naturally spontaneously we do no plan needed
Similarly super consciousness can create universe just like that
Krishna everywhere will watch all your activities
Guru asked disciples to eat in a place where nobody was watching
Lord watches wherever u go..One student did not find that place
Reactions are going to come for our  activities
We want to imitate god that's why we came here to earth
With so.much effort we are sending satellites to know what's going on..But god knows without boundaries-- super consciousness
Rain water is pure when it covered over by mid it becomes dirty
Soul in contact with wrong designations..Like Brahman Canadian
Consciousness types
1.jagruthe awake
2.swapna dream
3.susupthi deep sleep
4.death: extended sleep
After death , soul enters woomb
7 month consciousness comes
Warms irritates baby son
Pungent food irritates
Baby prays god to let him come out and he will worship him
As soon as he comes out , forgets

Consciousness is transformed it never be annihilated

When you are in dream state you forgets awake state
When u r in any of the other 3 u forgets awake state

Kings dream
He was a Butter fly ln last night in his dream and it was realistic
He was sucking sector
He summoned all his ministers
I woken up now...Am i that butterfly now
Actually u r neither butterfly nor king
All illusion
Soul is in the body of king

I am not this body
Eternal servants of krishna
Devotional service to god
Sravanam keerthanam

By chanting automatically wake up from other 3 consciousness

What is the proof that harikrishna manthra awakes soul
Practice it..It energises and creates awareness
Superimposed on the other 3 states
Try cococloa cococloa u can't

Follow 4 regulative principles to be intune with consciousness

Saintly souls often comes to earth to wake up ..jeeeve jago

Soul is sachith ananda
Currently dormant ..By chanting awaken it
Krishna consciousness original identity of soul..We are imposing..Just awakening

Size of the thumb is size of the super soul..

He is present in the heart of every living entity..Atoms

Nothing can remain once soul leaves the body

So aham: i am that
I am god
Drop can not be ocean it is a part of it
