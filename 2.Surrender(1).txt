Topic: Surrender
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


How to surrender?

Surrender exclusively to Krishna, with greatest urgency and without fear.

why to surrender?

TO get out of the material miseries and desires.

Important thing is deciding whom to surrender.



Bhagavad gita is full offpractical applications of real life.Surrender is tremondous practiacl application. 


Teachings of The Lord chaitanya maha prabu to sanathana goswamy.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


spirit soul is pure devote.we have to revive that bond.

what we need to do to surrender:
--------------------------------------------------------------

i)Anukulsya ----


Devote must accept favpourable things to bhakthi.


ii) Devote must reject unfavourable things to bhakth.


Rupa goswamy brother of sanathana goswamy has depicted in upedesmrutha: 

i) favourable things (6):
------------------

1) Uthsaha--> devote should be enthusiastic,and not be lazy to take initiative of spirtual activities. 


*One should be intelligent to know the importnce of spirtaul life.


2) Confidense--> shoul have confidence on krishana consciousness.

one should have confidence that krishna will grant the required things by following bhakthi.

3) Patience-->one shoul be patient to become a pure devotee.

*if u have a severe disease(forgetting Krishna) it takes long time to cure, 
eventhough the treatment and medicines(if u r practicing all regulative princilples) are being taken. 


Ex: Mukunda--lord Chaitanya (Mercyful lord) abbonded him from the association for millions of years.

All other devotes requested mahaprabu to re take MUkunda, but Mahaprabu rejected and said that he has to take millions of births. 
Hearing it Mukunda jumped hoping that he will get a chance even after 1 millon births.

In our case:
--------------
Chant holy name atleast for months to get the taste.


4) follow regulative principles

Do's:
-----
Chnat regularly.
Associate with devoyees regularly.
Read scriptures faithfully.
Eat nothing else but prasadam.

Dont's
------
No meat eating. 
NO intoxication.
NO gambling.
NO illicit sex.


*who is vaishnava --> one who abandon association of non devotes.
*In Bussiness life u can associate and for bussiness purpose.

5) follow the foot steps of Mahajan

They have set up required standards.We have to ambide to their thinking and vision.


ii) Unfavourable things (6):
--------------------------


1) Eating more than absolutely necessary.
Earning more and more money and collecting more and more.


2)Prayasa: Doing difficult endevor like an Ass simply for a piece of bread.

 working day and night simply for body enjoyment and to create favourable environment for body.


3)Unnecessary talk: 

go anywhere and observe people used to talk about mundane subjects.
we have an iresistable urje to talk.

99.99% of people talk nonsense, allkinds of mundane knowledje and glorified maya.

*talk krishna katha that make sense, things related to krishna and his service.


4)Niyamagraha:

 a)very much attached to the relegious princilples with out knowing  the purpose of rules and regulations.
Mechnical puja in homes, mounavratha etc.

b)not following any regulative principles.
*proper understnding, right mode and consciousness arerequired while practicing regulative principles.

5)Janasangrash: assocition of non devotes

6)Execessive greed of material things.
trying to earn quick money approching stock market and lottery.



iii) firm faith that only krishna can protect me.
-------------------------------------------------

only krishan can protect us..no--bank bal,insurance,watch man...

Ex:Dhroupathi- In the assembly hall of Hasthinapur infront of all her exceptionally very strong 5 husbands  and the protector of Kuru dynast Bhishma.

she tried herself to protect with single hand later realized only krishna can protect her.

Raised both her hands and then Krishna incarinated in the form of saree and protected.

*Devotee should have faith that krishna will definitelly protect him.
