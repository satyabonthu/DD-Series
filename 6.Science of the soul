
BG 2.13

Every day we have to remind ourselves that I am not this body.
At any moment we will be misdirected.


You are soul not body but whole world is under illusion that they are body.

What is the difference between dead and live body?

symptoms of life - consciousness is missing.
Ability to feel and perceive.

What is the source of consciousness?
Chemicals are present in the both dead and live.
and within a moment person dies, we say person has gone keeping dead body in front.

All the chemicals in a body cost few hundred rupees.

If no consciousness no body keeps it more than 2 days.

Soul is giving this consciousness.
From childhood to old age body is changing but same soul reside inside it.

Located at heart spreds it's energy through out body. like sun located at one position and spreds sunshine.

From sunshine you can infer sun.

Proof to the existence of soul is consciousness.

Dheera: one who have perfect practical and theoretical knowledge of the individual soul and super soul.
He doesn't lament if any one dies.

Properties of soul:
Eternally blissfull
can't cut .,fire, moisture, break.

Eternal blissfull soul in the temporary miserable body.

Maya is thinking that we are this miserable body.

Due to illusion soul gets bewildered.
Story: king kshitra Sethu
Powerful king , he had no son
Anjeera muni approached king and asked his problem.
Puthra delivers his ancestors from hellish planets.
If you are a devotee of the Lord automatically these are taken care.
Then muni performed yajna and said that he will beget a son who gives jubilant and grief.
So much attached to his son.
All other queens are jealous, killed that son.
King is so disappointed and crying.

Narmada muni and Sethu explains:
What relationship do you have with this dead body.
A group of jeevatmas are brought together like sand at the shore and disappear.
Our situation and relationships are temporary.

Temporary relationships have meaning only having background eternal relationship with god.
Taking care of family and relationship with god should go parallel.
Krishna is the real seed giving father.
We have to revive that relationship.

If you love serve god automatically serve and love everyone.
Spiritual level we all are brothers.
