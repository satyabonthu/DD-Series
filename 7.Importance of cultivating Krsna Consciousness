BG 2.14
Beginning of spiritual knowledge is understand that we are not this body.
Absorption in bodily conception is illusion.
Pain and pleasure exepereincing with body are not related soul.

Body is actually dead, soul is the life.

Soul is eternally happy, it can't enjoy and suffer.

But who is experiencing pleasure and pain?
But soul is imagining as a body and experiencing it.
Overwhelming bodily conception and feeling that
I am happy , enjoying , un happy all dualities.

Mathra sparsha- out of  contact with  senses.
It is like scratching the itching to get pleasure.

5 jnanedriya
5 karmendriya
5 sense object

When senses interact with sense objects like and unlike happy and pain will come.

We have to tolerate this dualities.
We must not hesitate to do our duties.
In coarse of spiritual life we have to follow regulative principles but we hesitate to  do it. Like not doing prescribed rounds ..
