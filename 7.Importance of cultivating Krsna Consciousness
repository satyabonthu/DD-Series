BG 2.14
Beginning of spiritual knowledge is understand that we are not this body.
Absorption in bodily conception is illusion.
Pain and pleasure exepereincing with body are not related soul.

Body is actually dead, soul is the life.

Soul is eternally happy, it can't enjoy and suffer.

But who is experiencing pleasure and pain?
Body is made of dead matter like other objects but how it is experiencing?
if you hit mike satnd it wont fell pain.
In bodily conception body goes all imaginary conceptions like dreams..
it is cold, hot .....

But soul is imagining as a body and experiencing it.
Overwhelming bodily conception and feeling that
I am happy , enjoying , un happy all dualities.

Mathra sparsha- out of  contact with  senses...rubbing of the skin..nothing but rubbing for itching skin..
It is like scratching the itching to get pleasure.

5 jnanedriya(knowledge acquiring)-eye,nose,tongue,hear,skin
5 karmendriya(organs by which you work)-tongue,leg
5 sense object-touch,sight,hearing,taste

When senses interact with sense objects like and unlike happy and pain will come.

We have to learn to tolerate this dualities.
pain-pleasure.



We must not hesitate to do our duties on the basis of mathra sparsha..

we have to tolerate all this dualities subtle mathra sparsha
In coarse of spiritual life we have to follow regulative principles but we hesitate to  do it. Like not doing prescribed rounds ..
