Nothing superior than me like pearls rest on thread everything rests on me.

Who is the supreme?
Krishna is saying he is that.
He declared that he is the source of everything.

Even devathas bewildered to decide who is the supreme, naturally pitty human beings will be bewildered.
Ex:
Dhruv muni is appointed to decide supreme Lord out of Brahma Vishnu and Maheswar by devathas.
Brahma- mode of passion father of him.
He did not offer obeciencess to Brahma, then he lost his temper And became anger.
Dhruva muni decided that Brahma is not the superior.

Siva:
walked into private quarter of Siva.
When Siva trying to embrace him he  refused saying that he can not embrace body of ashes.
Then Siva turned furious.
Dhruva muni decided that Siva is also not the supreme Lord.

Vishnu: lying on seshu.
Dhruva muni kicked on his chest. He got up politely and said  that his chest may be hard, asked apologize.
Completely renounced Vishnu is the supreme, he decided.

But Lakshmi cursed dhruvamani, where ever your groups stay I won't stay there.

Krishna expands into Vishnu tathvams in various occasions. So the ultimate supreme Lord is the Krishna.


Even demigods forget Krishna supremecy.
Brahma want to test the little Krishna.
Ex: In brindavan when Lord Krishna sitting in the forest with cowherd boys and taking care of cows.
All the cows disappeared and Brahma hided all cows and cowherd boys in a cave.

Krishna expanded into exactly same form of cow and cowherd boys.
When Brahma return back after one second ( year here) baffled by seeing cows and cowherd boys in cave and outside.

Brahma- creator uprooted and surrendered to little Krishna.
Krishna showed his actual form and so many Vishnu forms.

Similarly Indra: supplier of rain
Krishna said don't worship him instead worship govardhan.
Indra infuriated and set up heavy torrents of rain..
Effortlessly with little finger lifted up govardhan..After 7 days Indra realized and came down to surrendere Krishna.

We have to take reference of Shasta's words of God to realize supreme personality of Godhead.


People out of sentiment or being told are following from ages could not able to recognize supreme Lord Krishna.

Asitha , Narada and vysa all great munies  declared that Krishna is the supreme.

Lord Krishna himself says he is the supreme. Pearls are resting on thread we have to understand that all these planets resting perfectly on Krishna.
Krishna is personal:
Like light is coming from bulb, all energies are expanded from Krishna.his energies are spread everywhere like light.

No scientific law can be drawn by denying Lord.

Sun (vivaswan) person and sunshine energy.

We have to understand that supreme personality of Godhead is Krishna.
What is our Relationship with God?
Constitutional position is to do loving service by bhakthi to Krishna without any interrupts
, motivation and conditions.

Unless you do this devotional service you can not be satisfied.

Material achievements gives little satisfaction but not full.

Krishna:
He is the source of everything but he doesn't have source.
Beginning of everything but he doesn't have beginning.

Krishna instructed Arjuna.
remember when you fight.

Offer your material bussiness to Krishna and remember him by chanting.
