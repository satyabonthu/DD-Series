Topic: Real freedom:BG - chapter 18. Verse 66
----------------------------------------------

Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me. I shall deliver you from all sinful reaction. Do not fear.

surrender: nobody like to surrender.Likes to be master but not servant
---------
	Being servant is glorious, knowing whom u want to be servant ?


our nature is to surrender.soul is eternal servant of krishna. Actual home is spirtual world and work is serving lord.
we have misused free will given by Krishna and thrown here to satisfy our desires.


Material world is an expert arrangement for false enjoyer.
In the journey of seeking enjoyment we are frustrated.God wants us to learn from own frustration in the material journey.


After millions and millions years wondering around and being in different species and universities, realizes and surrenders to the god by grace of guru and Krishna.

karmabandan:
------------

If u want to work for your own enjoyment, we will be entagled in action and bound to action and reaction.

In this journey we are forced to take birth and death.

Enjoying seperately from krisna is impossibe.

But Krishna gives freedom and free will to travel in our own journey of seeking false enjoyment.
If frustrted come, father won't forget children.He comes in different avtaras and sends mahatmas.

why should i surrender?  Releaves all miseries, krishna promises.

swarat-->supreme independent to whom we need to surrender.

mam ekam: Exclusively and completely surrender.

Materialist: Many golas in life tosses you to various objects like foot ball.

so many concated dharmas like Manav dhrama ,hindu dharma, kula dharma etc..
Bodily conception dharmas are temporary moreover you keep changing body. 


sanathan dhrma is eternal.

What is dharma: An essential quality of living ententity that can not be seperated.
Like sweetness of sugar and heat of fire.

--> service to krishna (dharma) is covered by maya illusion over million years.

------------------------

Heart purifies by association and chanting and then we can understand who is krishna.
