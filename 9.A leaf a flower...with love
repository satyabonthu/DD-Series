How to execute Krishna consciousness.
What is Krishna consciousness ?
Understand Krishna is supreme Lord .I am part and parcel supreme soul and ,I have to serve him with love.

We have forgotten that bond showing that love other objects.
Love means sacrifice and offering
We have to exchange love him with by offering like leaf water fruit.

Does he need something from us.
He doesn't need but we are in need of giving him.

Everything is his property yet he says he will receive it because of love and devotion.

Like a child offering something to father..He will be happy.

Whatever quota we got if we offer he will be happy.

People offer water of Ganges to mother Ganges. Similarly everything is belonging to Krishna but we offer it with love and exception.

A sense of gratitude to offer him whatever he gives.
Your crop clothes machinery ...

We have to accept Poverty for oneself and opulnace for god.

Prasad means mercy. More you offer for Lord Krishna less you need.

Sacrifice for Krishna is the proper reciprocation.

How can i offer to Krishna who I can't see?
Just for the sake of expecting our service he appeared in 2 avatars
1. Holy name
2. Diety

Difference between ideal and diety
Form made according to scriptures.

Self realized souls can realize that.
Form of a diety is not a concated one.

Archa vigraha is authorized form like a valid post box which is used to deliver it right person.

How can Krishna eat?
He says he will accept it.
Sudhama ...

Some say god is every where why should we go to temple?
Yuga dharma is chanting holy name. But
Diety worship purifies us.

We are conditioned by experience and situations.

Sachithananda vigraha..
For our sake he manifested in this material world.

In diety worship all manthraas revolve around holy name.

We will attract more and more by diety worship.
God says As you approach me I will react.

We should have faith in God..By serving him we will get that.

Sakshi gopal in Orissa.
2 brahmins go for spiritual tour.
A murthy of gopal overwhelmed by this diety.
One is old and another is young and serves him. Out of gratitude elder brahmin says he offer to give her daughter as a wife.
Younger brahmin is so poor and said your family may not accept me.
But elder one says my family definitely accepts.
Asked elder brahmin to do promise infront of gopal .
But after reaching home family does not accept , they said they will die.
Older brahmin says I did not remember this promise.
Then younger brahmin called all local to Panchayat.
Family concates that younger cheated out of greedy.
Then he said he will prove .
Lord gopal is eyewitness I will ask him to come here for witness.
Younger one go to Brindavan told the whole story.
You should come to vidyangar he asks gopal.
Under condition he should not look back.
He looked back after reaching vidyangar gopal was there.
Gopal speaks to every one.

Diety reciprocates according to our devotion.
Younger brahmin treats diety as the god ask to come to vidyangar.

Questions

How deities will get different names?
According to situations and and circumstances and purpose.

Why should not imagine diety while chanting?
Holy name is independent supreme process.
But diety worship revolves around holy name.

How people simply treat it as ideal
Eventhough god is there?
Service to god develops that love.

For the pleasure of devotes and purposes Lord comes in different form.

More you beautify dieties more your  desires will reduce.

More you serve Lord more your desires to serve yourself will reduce.

Who is suffering body mind soul?
Soul is eternally blissfully
Body is dead one
Soul is part of body
Happinesses and distress is a illusion because it comes and goes
Like winter and summer.actully nothing is suffering this is all mid identification.
