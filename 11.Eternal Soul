When soul comes into body of maya..Forgetfulness comes.
Maya is like cloud..
Like Clouds blocking vision of sunlight but not sun.

Simple cloud can not block sun..Sun is never blocked..Only our vision is blocked for Krishna.

We lost sight of who we are and who is god.

Body is like a dream,
We forget who we are.

Seated on heart..
